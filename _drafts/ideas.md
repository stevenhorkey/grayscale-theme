Children have to be socialized well, meaning they have to test boundaries of what's right and wrong, safe and unsafe. If they don't get an adequate chance to repeatedly do that, they don't know where those boundaries lie. It's not like those are exactly obvious, as a child you are born into a world that is completely and utterly mystical by the nature of its mere existence. That only fades when you grow up into believing these necessary boundaries are absolute when they are in fact only tools to survive and thrive in the world as a human being. Thus, there is a trade off that has to be carefully considered.
