                <p>Welcome, my name is Steven Horkey and Meme and Meaning is a project of mine where I seek to learn, understand, and emobdy a life well lived. I'm young, I'm hopeful, I'm scared, and I'm niave among many other things but in my eyes there is nothing more important than living this thing well. The reality is that what you want, seek, and need will be different at the level of detail for all of us, but from a meta perspective that looks at the totallity of the human condition, we are all looking for fulfillment and purpose in the midst of life's inherent suffering and chaos. In many ways this is a documentation of my journey through personal development and holistic understanding, but just as equally it is an effort to help you do the same. As such I am looking into many fields from many differing perspectives in the hopes of leading an intentional life and leaving a positive impact. 
                <br>

                I am here for self actualization; to find truth wherever it may lie. May you do the same... </p>
