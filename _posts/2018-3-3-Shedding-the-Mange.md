What do you need from me today?
<br>
<br>
Is your fear running from itself, from the possible judgment that lies ahead?
<br>
<br>
Whether you like it or not, you are going to have to let go sooner than later if you want more; that is just a leap of faith you are going to have to make. This neuroticism is not serving you. It's not serving anyone. There will always be people who dislike what you create, and there will always be people who adore it. Neither matter. 
<br>
<br>
**The real question is do you love it and is it helping anyone?** If so, move on and get to work because all the boxes are checked.
<br>
<br>
The time you spend dwelling on the criticism and the "what ifs" is wasted. Look at it and let it burn until you shed the mange.
