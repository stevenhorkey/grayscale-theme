What is a metaphysical question?
<br>
<br>
When broken down, the basic etymology reveals that meta denotes that which is beyond, and physical that which is... what?
<br>
<br>
It seems we have to know the latter before we can answer this question.
<br>
<br>
Does physical denote that which multiple, if not all, observers can experience? Does the consensus of what we know through the senses hold the essence of the concept 'physical'?
<br>
<br>
Lets lay out some criteria (and some common definitions):

- relating to the external world as opposed to the inner, subjective world.
- referring to things perceived through the consensus of senses; tangibly concrete

What I want to know is the meaning of physical in the objective sense. It would seem, however, that no one has an experience of the 'physical' world; only a mental, subjective representation of it.
<br>
<br>
Where our representations converge is that which we deem physical, meaning existing independent of ourselves and our perception of it.
<br>
<br>
Yet, is there not a leap there? If physical merely means the consensus on the convergence of our senses, then what we have is a posited, unempirical proposition. To posit an external, independent world existing independently of any observer (meaning of any experience) inherently leads one to a conclusion that is not only untestable but is beyond the scope of empiricism itself. 
<br>
<br>
And is this not what is colloquially termed 'metaphysical'? Usually, when there is a conclusion that is unfalsifiable, that is called metaphysical. It is only an axiom, which is a more delicate, more pompously intellectual world for a groundless assumption.
<br>
<br>
That's not to say, however, that it is a 'bad' one, or an impractical one. It is EXTREMELY practical. 
<br>
<br>
And yet, most of us wouldn't say that something being practical is necessarily true. Some may argue that, but if they who form such opinions have a point, then there is also a point to the notion that they stand on that conclusion to assuredly protect some other outcome they came to cherish first.
<br>
<br>
In that case, they can't claim to hold reason above all else, and maybe they shouldn't. I'm not here to say what is better. 
<br>
<br>
What I'm wondering is whether we assume the physical as a conceptual placeholder for the practicality of survival. It is much like the gestalt triangles. There is no start below, but the mind seems to enjoy finding patterns. Would there be a star if one 'Pacman' fell away? Is the whole appearance of the star not dependent on each icon in the exact position or perspective that it is in? 
<br>

I think this is an excellent example for a few reasons. Namely that we can see each icon as one of the five senses. 
<br>
<br>
In actuality, I would consider thought the sixth general sense, but hardly no one except one-year-olds think that thoughts are objectively 'physical,' at least in their phenomenological sense. 
<br>
<br>
Each of the icons converge, there's that word again, to form a coherent shape in the same way that each of the senses converge to create a cohesive world. This could be said about almost anything perhaps: organized words to form meaningful sentences, organized sentences to form meaningful paragraphs, and organized paragraphs to form meaningful narratives. So are not narratives, or better put stories, anything more then the meaning or pattern inferred from the organized phrasing of its parts?
<br>
<br>
What about group identity? Is there really such thing as a group identity or is it nothing more than a collection of individuals oriented in such a way to assume a shared sense of commonality? 
<br>
<br>
What about the self itself? Again the senses come together, especially as thought and feeling, to form a seemingly stagnant or solidified sense of self. Yet our thoughts and ideas change, and that could be seen as a constant flux of icons on any given shape. Our bodies change as we grow old and our cells are replaced. And furthermore, our bodies are too another concept that is given form by a collection of other items.
<br>
<br>
And so is this a reliable conclusion? Concepts themselves, be they regarding the self, the group, the world, the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly... are they merely an assumption seen as the pattern between the empiricism of the collected senses? 
<br>
<br>
What are we to make of the concept 'metaphysical' if there is little substance in the word 'physical' to begin with.
<br>
<br>
What I think people mean when in the usual sense of the term is that which is outside the scope of the verifiable senses; that which is commonly experienced within a reasonable degree and concluded to be the same.
<br>
<br>
Something is then especially metaphysical when it is untestable and thus unable to be known for certain.
<br>
<br>
So, is the external, independent world that we define as physical a metaphysical proposition itself?
<br>
<br>
I don't know, I'm written and glazed past numerous words that deserve their own deconstruction as well. 
<br>
<br>
But, if that is the case, and it sure seems like there is some merit or at least partial truth in the argument, then the objective world is as good as god. 
<br>
<br>
Both are unknowables. Unfalsifiable and posited by humans to make our lives easier. 
<br>
<br>
This is a complicated matter. The only thing I feel confident in expressing is that ontology and epistemology are two sides of the same coin, and just as a coin, it is the juxtaposition of both that gives meaning to one other.
<br>
<br>
I would like to see someone draw an implied coin, now there is a mindfuck...
