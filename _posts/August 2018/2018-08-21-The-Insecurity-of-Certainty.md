As I see it, we have two means to find Truth. There are the senses, of feeling, seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and thinking, and there is the faculty of human reason; both of which seem to be limited.

<br>

The current scientific dictum tells us that a single individual's phenomenological experience is too fallible to be trusted on their word alone. There instead must be a consensus of these accounts, discussed with the very least posited in the most parsimonious tale. 

<br>

And yet, as soon as we crossed from the direct to the spoken "truth," we have relinquished our contact with the most immediate and ineffable. 

<br>

The question is whether reason could escape the limits of language. 



The question is whether logic could point to that thing written in the stars that justifies it's very method. And even if it could, would it then have to succumb to the final word resting outside of its structure and method?

<br>

Could symbols ever genuinely represent the sensed? Could a species evolved for survival and reproduction be coincidentally equipped with all the senses and all the tools to arrive at the absolute Truth and nature of things?

<br>

Can anyone show me where it has been objectively ruled what counts as legitimate evidence? Because as of now, I am inclined to think that such a decision is a pragmatic line drawn in the sand to close the concern and move on to more exciting things.

<br>
<br>

Ultimately I am not sure... and part of me is not sure if I am even not sure. I may be selling myself doubt to put off the hard pill of a meaningless existence. And even that, I feel doesn't capture everything I am trying to convey. 

<br>

Part of me is too lazy to put in the time to find out, after all, I am not immune to the desires and aversions common among a twenty-year-old privileged young man in college. In some sense, there may be a substantial point there: if these things were going to be answered, they would have been so already after the thousands, and thousands of years humans have considered such matters. 

<br>

And I wonder how many of those years, where men and women poured their time into such questions, were little more than the desire to differentiate themselves. How much of philosophy has been the pastime to claim righteous praise over all other endeavors? 

<br>

How much status, attention, money, sex, and worthiness have been bestowed upon those who claimed to have found the absolute Truth of things? For those few who were able to convince their compatriots into the masses, such a gift of certainty has been priceless. 

<br>

And for the rest of these 'philosophers', did they have anything else to set themselves apart from the common status and condition of the men around them?

<br>

If I am honest with myself, I don't feel confident in saying that I aspire towards truth for purely innocent reasons. On the whole, I would say that my motives, insecurities, and justifications change, and in my better moments I can see beyond the social pressure and in my more common, lowly moments, I can hardly remember anything outside of it.

<br>
<br>

The most reassuring thing about this human predicament is the fact that it changes. Nothing lasts. Something similar may come around again, and to varying degrees, it'll be better or worse.  

<br>

And yet, here I again started out with serious questions only to delve into my own psychological shortcomings. Maybe every theory and philosophic system published should come with a disclaimer of all it's authors shallow and existential fears. Mr. Nietsche said that the philosophy needs to be read in the context of the philosopher's life, and I think if you found your way to such solitary questions, you probably came because the alternatives were too painful or too glaringly stupid.

<br>

I would like to one day finally decide that I just don't know, and thus can't be certain about anything. Right now, however, I am too preoccupied with obligations (which always means excuses to a more or lesser degree) to parse out the distinctions between the concepts at hand. 

<br>

Before answering such questions, terms must be defined, and to be defined means to have a clear and definite boundary between two supposed opposites. Right now,  I am not confident that such absolute distinctions can be made without a leap of reason, and where there are vague definitions, there are vague conclusions. Where there are vague conclusions, there is the evident tool of reason weilded by the shaking hands of emotion, instinct, and convenience.

<br>

However, maybe this is the best place one can be: that space between the proclamation of knowing, and the proclamation of the definitive not-knowing. Both make a claim to certainty, and in that crevice between the innumerable ways that they are both same and different, maybe there is a spot where the existential fatigue is the most sobering call to finally choose to appreciate, instead of loath, all that is.
