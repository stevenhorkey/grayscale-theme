Make it known that these doubts you endure are not yourself but are the voices of those who surround and afflict you with their own case of doubts, from those who surround and afflict them. There are no original murderers of aspiration, no original destroyers of intuition. Who then, can you blame in this life? Products after products, civilization continues and pumps out those who you see now. In some ways regressing, and in some ways advancing, but always on the shoulders of those who accepted responsibility and ownership for their lot. Those who made a concerted effort to move forward despite their flaws and despite the flaws inherent to this condition. The individuals who thought not along the lines of these universal doubts but along the lines of their inner daemon. And no, it is not an easy feat to toe that line when all others are pulling you down unconsciously by the mental mechanics of the ones who forged the gears before them ad infimumâ€¦ but would you want it any other way? The biggest tragedy we face in life is not that we lose something, but that we gain the arrogance of thinking that there is anything to lose in the first place. This thing is going to kill you, and if you are to make anything of yourself, and by make I mean to forge a suitable contribution, character, and understanding, you must drop your hoard of security. You must learn to willingly chip pieces off that iconic bust you hold so dearly in your mind and relinquish the false guise of perfection and certainty that we all work so hard to protect. You must drop your self-image, and what is a self but a persistent drop?
