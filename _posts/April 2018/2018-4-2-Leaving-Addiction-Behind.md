Bad habits are not something you can shame yourself out of doing. You, more than anyone, should now that such a reason is not compelling enough to you. 
<br>
<br>
If you actually want to change, it will not come about through the person you are now. It will not come about if you remain in the same routines, environment, and mindset.
<br>
<br>
When you are ready to leave everything associated with it behind, when your priorities have shifted, when your time has been placed elsewhere, and when you see that reverting back is not worth the disruption of your new found momentum, that is when things will change. 
<br>
<br>
Self-disgust and guilt will be of little help here. You must ask yourself why you would change if you didn't have a compelling reason to. Why would you change if that changed person wasn't worth the struggle to get there?
<br>
<br>
So then, the problem is that you can't see the person who you could become. You can't see how possible it is because this is all you have come to know.
<br>
<br>
Consider that poor habit or addiction that you are so attached to. Consider how it serves you and how you truly enjoy it. 
<br>
<br>
Now consider your child watching you do that thing. Think about a world where your mistakes played a role in your child going on to do and face the same mess.
<br>
<br>
Consider the people on the other end. Consider all the time you already have, and will continue to waste. Consider the fact that a year from now, you will be in the same place wishing that the you of today did what they will eventually have to do. Consider that you don't want this for yourself, how you don't want this for anyone. Consider how you, as of now, are literally a waste of resources. A waste of time and fresh air.
<br>
<br>
You need more important things to do. You need things that a better, more competent person would do. You need some obligations, a routine, and a steady schedule. 
<br>
<br>
You need a compelling vision for the person you could be and the life you could lead. You need a bit of direction and starts with self-reflection. Do you want to change? Are you ready to change? Do you know how this problem is currently serving you and what priorities in your life need to change? 
<br>
<br>
You must understand that one's state of consciousness is not a determiner, but instead a catalyst. What do you need to think about and remember when the last thing you want to do is make the better decision? What version of you needs to show up when you are in the realm of the hungry ghosts?
<br>
<br>
Change is possible. People have done it and it would be a good idea if you learned about them and their stories. About the advice they may have, and the person they had to leave behind.
<br>
<br>
On some level, however, you think that such things arent possible, at least for you. Because when you turn to the porn, the food, the drugs, or whatever else it may be, in your mind you think about that fact that you have tried to change, and you failed. You think about how you can't do this, that, or the other.
<br>
<br>
Are you motivated by shame or by aspiration?
<br>
<br>
Are you hopeless? Only you can decide and only you can find out.
<br>
