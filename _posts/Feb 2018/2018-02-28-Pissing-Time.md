What do they mean when they say time is spent? Are our lives nothing more than the currency of eternity? 
<br>
<br>
Perhaps, and perhaps certainly. 
<br>
<br>
For it is all we have; the soujourner we cannot and will not get back. The time you've spent on entertainment, vanity, and anger, have they been worth it?  Have they been worth it knowing that you may look upon them when the bell tolls and finally see the weight of your error? 
<br>
<br>
**You could claim that such times were necessary to be where you are now, to learn from and reflect, and fair enough… but how much time do you still need to be where you are now?** It's about *time*, don't you think? To think long and hard about contributing something and taking responsibility for turning those lost "foes" into friends, and friends into family. When will it be the right time, how much more do you have to piss away to the wind? 
<br>
<br>
If you find that you can't wake up with a sense of urgency, then think harder, build a bigger vision and shut yourself out from all else until you find whatever calling you *need*; something you would suffer tremendously for. Pull out pictures from the past. Pull out pictures and stories from those dying in regret - from the Holocaust and the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge. Contemplate the death of the five closest people in your life and think about what changes you believe the world needs most. 
<br>
<br>
**What does the world need most? What kind of person does the world need most? Is that you?**
