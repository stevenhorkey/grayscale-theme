Your life is built, or ruined, a day at a time. It is those activities you do day in and day out that make the difference years down the road. 
<br>
<br>
There are some things which I believe would benefit virtually everyone, or at least have the potential for doing so.
<br>
<br>
By no means is this a comprehensive list but none the less, if you were to implement all or a few of these, I think you would notice a positive difference in your life.
<br>
<br>
**Meditation**
<br>
<br>
The potential is bottomless and thus the benefits are countless. There is perhaps no greater tool if you wish to gain greater composure, compassion, contentment, and understanding of yourself and others.

- Headspace App
- Stephen Proctor Youtube Playlist

<br>
**Reading Non-Fiction**
<br>
<br>
Humans have basically distilled the optimal ways of life into books. The techniques, tools, and principles that foster the growth and becoming of your potential can be found here. If you have a problem, it's almost guaranteed that someone has written a book on how to solve it. If you don't know what to do with your time, pick up a book or listen to one. Here are a few I recommend:
- Walden by Henry David Thoreau
- The Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
- Self Reliance by Ralph Waldo Emerson
- Mastery by George Leonard
- Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl

<br>
**Podcasts**
<br>
<br>
Listening to long form conversations brings a whole different level of authticity and depth compared to other forms of media. Here are a few I enjoy
<br>
- Actualized.org
- Rich Roll
- Tangentially Speaking
- The Robcast

<br>
**Solitude in Nature**
<br>
<br>
Solitude is the fountain from which many, if not all, insights arise. By being in nature, we connect with that original source and gain a greater appreciation; a sense of mystery.

**Cardiovascular Movement**
<br>
<br>
Your heart is the engine of your body. It would be wise if you paid respect to it.
- Running
- Cycling
- Swimming
- Sports

<br>
**Stretching**
<br>
<br>
The body does not remain limber on its own accord. A few stretches daily go a long way to creating a greater sense of stability and flexibility in your body.

<br>
**Weight Training**
<br>
<br>
The goal is not necessarily to be a bodybuilder but increased, functional muscle mass is important for longevity and overall health. 
- Pull-ups
- Pushups/Bench Press
- Pike Press/Shoulder Press
- Rows
- Squats/Deadlifts
- Curls/Overhead Press

<br>
**Tea**
<br>
<br>
Coffee is fine once in a while but tea has a plethora of benefits. There is a reason why healthy, long-living populations drink a ton of the stuff. There are too many to name so try and find some kinds you like. Cut the sugar out though. 
- Green Tea
- Bengal Spice Tea
- Chamomile Tea

<br>
**Whole Food Based Diet**
<br>
<br>
No one can argue that eating some more vegetables would be bad for you. Chow down and add whole plant foods to crowd out the processed junk.
- Forks over Knives
- Eat to Live by Joel Furhman
- Nutritarian Diet

<br>
**Meaningful Music**


<br>
**Journaling/Writing**
<br>
<br>
You do not know what you think until you have seen in front of you; until you have organized it and built it up from the scrambled mess in your mind. Not everyone needs to be a writer, but we would all be better off if we had the skills to sort out our thoughts in a coherent, honest way.


<br>
**A Creative Endeavor**
<br>
<br>
A unique feeling comes with the embodiment of creativity. In a most surreal sense, everything we do is a creative act, the question is whether it is something you want and love to do or not.
- Painting/Drawing
- Speaking/Writing
- Instrument/Singing


<br>
**Studying Psychology**
<br>
<br>
- Spiral Dynamics
- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
- 


<br>
**Something that Scares You**
<br>
<br>
All growth lies outside our comfort zone. I know it's difficult, but if you can see yourself as the person you could become instead of the person that you are, perhaps you will find the strength in the realization that the other option of stagnancy is far worse in the long run.
- Toast Masters
<br>
**Solo Travel**
<br>
<br>

<br>
**Service**
<br>
<br>
Are we here to help others? I don't know. But it sure feels good and if everyone was to take a role in their community, we would solve societal issues at their source: individuals and communities instead of countries and cultures.
