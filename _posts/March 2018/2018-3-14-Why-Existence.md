description: 'What must you do now so that the "you" in the future does not hold the same regret as you do currently? Or, said in another way, what do you have to do to make your future self-proud?What are the first steps towards making those things happen? Can you do at least that?'

People often dismiss philosophy as impractical jargon that is in many senses no more than some pompous theoreticians trying to one-up each other with their verbose language.
<br>
<br>
These people have a good point because there is plenty of egotism and verbosity going on.
<br>
<br>
However, to claim that philosophy and specifically the ponderance of the deepest and most existential questions are nothing more than impractical word games is naive in my opinion. 
<br>
<br>
Because the study of ontology (i.e. metaphysics - the study of what exists and why) and epistemology (the study of knowledge - whether we can absolutely know anything) get to the heart of what "all this is", and what "all this is" includes you and your life. 
<br>
<br>
Whether consciously or unconsciously, we are all walking around inside culture, and the very foundations of culture rest on metaphysical assumptions which already entail an assurance in whats true which is then concerned with epistemology.
<br>
<br>
Take, for example, the notion of free will: the entire justice and criminal system rests on the idea that we as people have free will where we can choose between different decisions and actions. This is ultimately unknown and it may never be known.
<br>
<br>
Another example is God. You may or may not be a believer in god but aside from that bucket of worms, we can't even agree what god is or what that symbol is pointing to if it points to anything at all.
<br>
<br>
What about purpose? What makes something true and why? Can you see that your whole life and what you believe is resting on these quicksands?
<br>
<br>
Perhaps this is why we suffer. Perhaps this is why mystics say we are all wrapped up in illusion. 
<br>
<br>
In my opinion, there is nothing in life quite like these questions, and besides getting to the point where everyone is treated with just respect and has what they need to thrive, what else is more important?
<br>
<br>
You could say that we will never be able to answer such questions, or even that it's up to science to figure it out, not the philosophers.
<br>
<br>
For sake of time,  I will not get into science aside from saying that it too is not free from interpretation or assumptions. Science, as it is practiced by many today, rests on a core set of axioms, which it has complete faith in. Not only this, but if you ever get into the philosophy of science, you will quickly see how the mainstream view of it is extremely exaggerated in its explanatory power. This is because it can only speak of what things do and how they interact with each other, not what they are in and of themselves. 
<br>
<br>
There is still mystery, and I would go as far to say that there is still only mystery. It can be a great thing - a very useful thing. But one does not need to understand the underlying nature of the game to be able to play with and manipulate its content.
<br>
<br>
But back to the notion that we will never be able to answer such questions. In principle, I think this is probably the case, but only in a limited sense. 
<br>
<br>
Maybe the issue is that we are trying to answer these questions, and understand the totality of reality with complex sets and arrays of symbols instead of direct experience. 
<br>
<br>
When it comes down to it, we can't explain anything with language. All of it is founded on referencing back to prior experience and memory. There is literally no way to effectively describe what vision is like to someone who was born blind. 
<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say, I hope not to answer any questions here - only to provoke more. Hopefully, that question is at the forefront of your mind - why existence? Why does anything, including myself, exist at all
<br>
<br>
What would you do if you found out that your entire life and identity was a farce?
<br>
<br>
If you believe that reality is made of material that obeys physical "lays", what would you do if you found out that it was not and that it doesn't?
<br>
<br>
If you believe in god, what would you do if you found out that he/she didn't exist, or that your characterization of what god is was completely backward?
