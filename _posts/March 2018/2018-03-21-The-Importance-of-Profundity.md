Life, at face value, can appear very mundane and undramatic. Perhaps this is part of the reason why we turn to movies and stories. These are the dramatic tales that vaguely represent our lives; or at least tales that distract us from our lives.
<br>
<br>
In either case, we yearn to feel more. We yearn to see heroism and archetypes played out because they are the timeless stories that envelop one with meaning, even if only for a brief period of time.
<br>
<br>
The problem is, however, that we believe our lives cannot be so extraordinary. Whether this is done through a development of limiting beliefs or a general lack of embodied examples, I do not know; it's probably a combination of the two.
<br>
<br>
What would it be like if we saw ourselves as part of a grander story? What if we saw ourselves in the context of a life with a greater calling? The human being needs direction, it needs a sense of autonomy and it needs profundity. Assuming you want a profound life, how can you expect to have one otherwise?
<br>
<br>
Such a life comes from a dedication to a greater purpose. It comes from facing yourself at each step along the journey. 
<br>
<br>
Why not listen to profound music? Why not write and speak in profound language? Why not do something crazy? Why not try something new? Why not travel without a plan? Why not enter the unknown? Why not do what you have wanted to do for years. 
<br>
<br>
Fuck, this is your life we are talking about. The only guarantee is death and I know there is some problem in the world that must compel you. There must be something that you want to create and share with others. If there isn't, what have you been doing? What have you been paying attention to? 
<br>
<br>
In one sense it takes an immense amount of suffering to be rattled into the appreciation of its universal magnitude. You don't really get a choice as to whether or not that changes - what you do get to do is respond in such a way where you utilize it for the betterment of others and yourself. 
<br>
<br>
Suffering is not something to hammer out of existence; to try would be a lost cause and only lead to further consequences. It is instead the hammer and the hammered - the reason and thus tool with which we aim to lessen the unnecessary forms of it. 
<br>
<br>
The only other option is to the tool towards the destruction of those who can suffer. If life is so tragic, pointless, and cynical, why not put people out of their misery. Why not redeem my misery by putting others through more? 
<br>
<br>
This is the thought process of mass murderers. This is the thought process of hopelessness and immature nihilism. In one sense they are romantics; they are people who perhaps appreciate life in a profound way yet lack a greater meaning; a benevolent rhyme or reason founded upon a deeper understanding of psychology and the condition we find ourselves in. 
<br>
<br>
Compassion is too painful for them. And on a smaller level perhaps the same can be said about us. When we fail to experience profundity, we are seduced by the appearance of it with entertainment, drugs, and stories. 
<br>
<br>
The problem with these, however, is not that there is something inextricably and inherently wrong with them, but that we never use them as a tool for self-reflection; as a means to look at ourselves and change how we think and act for the better. Could there be any other reason for them? Could there be any other reason for art?
<br>
<br>
Instead of being seduced by an endless rotation of these, why not reflect upon them and see how they relate to your life? Use them to reflect upon your relationship to the world. 
<br>
<br>
Whether you know it or not, you want direction. You want a feeling that you have enough control to create a better life in the future and avoid an opponent. You want profundity. Is there a sense of naivete that comes along with it? Perhaps and yet maybe only when you are too young to be anything but naive. 
<br>
<br>
This whole damn thing is a mystery and what is often called naivete is actually the wise, child-like curiosity that lights up a room at a young age yet shuts it down as you enter adulthood. Some people don't want to see you go after something they left behind long ago and in some sense, it's hard to not sympathize with them.
<br>
<br>
This is your life though. This may be it. Are you really going to waste your youth if you still have it? Whatever time you have left, are you really going to turn it in for less than it could be? Where is your profound life? Where did the idea of its possibility go? Why would you ever let it go?
<br>
<br>
From a certain perspective, there are only two possibilities: the profound life and the miserable one. Take your pick.
