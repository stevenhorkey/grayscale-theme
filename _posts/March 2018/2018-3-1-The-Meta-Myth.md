This journey you wish to embark on is well-known, yet not well trodden. For this is precisely the point, to enter into the unknown, the place you least want to look. 
<br>
<br>
This is the meta-myth, the story with "a thousand faces", told for eons that perhaps defines who we are, and what it means to <em>be</em>, as a human being. 
<br>
<br>
There will be temptation, and it is here where you get to purge your vices. There will be crises, and it is here where you get to act on or flounder in your level of preparation. There will be leaps of faith, and it is here where you must decide what matters most. There will be tears, and it is here where you get to accept the fate of being a finite animal. There will be doubt, and it is here where you get to face the boundaries of your psyche. There will be sweat, and it is here where you get to double down. There will be defeats, and it is here where you get to decide if they are failures. There will be anger, and it is here where you get to see through the mere appearance of things. There will be enemies, and it is here where you get to move forward and forgive, or stay back and ruin the both of you. There will be suffering, and it is here where you get to meet your maker.   
<br>
At the end of all this there will be the end of yourself or the end of yourself <em>as you know him</em>. These are the only two options at the end of this road and don't trick yourself into believing otherwise. 
<br>
<br>
**These trials are guaranteed to happen, and your job is not to avoid or disarm them, but to be a better, more courageous, and more competent person to the challenge.** The powers over you residing at your final destination lie nowhere else but in your heart of hearts. You will have to discover the end of your world in the process, and though help may present itself, you must walk this path alone.
