In a serious sense, I believe that less is needed to thrive in this world that is needed to survive. 
<br>
<br>
It has always been the case that most people struggle to have enough, or at least enough of what they think they need. It has also been the case, however, that people who have had too much have been worse off because of it.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps it's an evolutionary habit, perhaps it is a false pretense from one's upbringing but in either case, the accumulation of things and 'stuffs' is, by my estimation, a waste of everything human being's hold dear.
<br>
<br>
One needs to spend their time to earn the funds necessary to buy the things. They must spend some of that money feeding themselves just so they may spend more time collecting those funds. They trick themselves into thinking the road leads to anywhere and grow stressed in the event that things don't turn out the way they had hoped. 
<br>
<br>
Yes, one needs food, but one only has time. Why should your time go towards those things which make the least use of it? Why should you spend your time on an extravagant car or house? Why should you spend your time filling up an expanding closet or chasing the newest gadget? 
<br>
<br>
Are these things really making a substantial difference in your life? Can you not wait a week for the delusion of desire to pass before you spend any more time?
<br>
<br>
Perhaps you could try to clear out that closet. Perhaps you could try to clear those shelves and trade in that car and house for much more meager ones. You do not need much materially primarily because what you truly seek is immaterial: connection with yourself, nature, and others. Love and the chance to make another person's day. 
<br>
<br>
These are what you have actually wanted and they are so cheap that we made due to get them before we had any notion of currency or crop. 
<br>
<br>
I am in no way saying that all material things are unworthy of your attention - obviously, some tools were needed to develop talent. However, there is a line that is all too easy to cross and, at least in my experience, I am happier and richer in proportion to the things which I can afford to do without. 
<br>
<br>
I know that Thoreau and many others would say the same.

Call it minimalism, call it decluttering or an embodiment of the simple life. I will call it autonomy. I will call it freedom from the mistaken notions and beliefs that trick others into thinking anything is worth more than their precious, dwindling time.
