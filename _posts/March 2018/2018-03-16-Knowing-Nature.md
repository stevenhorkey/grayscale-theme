The more we learn, the more we see how naive we have been - at least if we have been paying attention. 
<br>
<br>
In regard to our view of nature, we have failed to understand that the mother herself does not play with or depend on a finite set of variables. If she does, it is only because we have shaded her into conceptually isolated and separate parts: a feature not of her, but of our finite, localized perspectives.
<br>
<br>
Everything, and I mean absolutely everything is interconnected. As such, it is likely incomprehensible too. To discount such statements as frivolous new age talk is useless. Put aside all your presuppositions, put aside what you think about nature and look upon her, as if for the first time. Have you lost that perrenial mystery, that timeless awe, reverence, and respect for being itself? Has the trade in of your humble ignorance been worth the illusion of a reductionist understanding?
<br>
<br>
There is nothing inherently wrong with the latter, but in the process of encasing ourselves in concrete, we have also entrapped our minds into thinking we could grasp an absolute, objective understanding of the world and her fruits that we are.
<br>
<br>
Yet is this not an outgrowth of nature? Is she not the one spraying pesticides upon herself? Bombing herself on the other side of herself? 
<br>
<br>
Sure. Why not? It's fine to think about it that way. But this is still missing and perhaps dismissing the point that we all care about. If we are to survive, and I would hope we should aspire for more, we cannot continue to sweep things further down the hallway and act like it will not have fatal consequences later on.
<br>
<br>
You cannot spray pesticides without tainting your mother's milk. You cannot strike fear without retaliation later on. You cannot torture other beings without collecting the painful consequences that they themselves would face if they only had the chance to live. 
<br>
<br>
You play a part in this thing we have going on. This unfolding event of society, culture, and life itself. Do you have a duty? Only if you want meaning; only if you want to feel alive. I don't have confidence in an absolute morality. I have no confidence in a judgemental father or god. I only, and soley have confidence in reality; that it may shake its feathers in whatever way it wants. 
<br>
<br>
The sun illuminates the murderer as much as it does the saint, the only difference is that one has seen the other in himself.
