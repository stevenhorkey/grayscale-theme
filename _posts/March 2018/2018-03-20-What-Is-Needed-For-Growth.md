We must not merely intuit our present situation and all it entails, we must fully understand it on both an experiential and conceptual level if we are to go beyond where we are now.
<br>
<br>
We must see our current possibilities, difficulties, addictions, and presuppositions distinctly in such a way where we come to know that they are not _the_ way, but instead *a* way.
<br>
<br>
Thus there are two great drivers: the pain of one's current situation and the desire to transcend it for the purpose of knowledge, harmony, and truth; with neither being mutually exclusive. At the level that most of us reside, however, pain is going to be the kicker, the thing that shakes us from the foundation we were born and embedded into. We will have to come to a point where we can no longer tolerate it after many repeated encounters of slamming our head against the wall. Here, we will try anything to get beyond our misery and rest on some form of solid ground.
<br>
<br>
In a sense then, we cannot be told anything about growth until we are ready to listen, meaning until we truly want to listen. Perhaps this is the reason why an intervention for some results in recognition, reflection, and action, while for others it results in further entrenchment and conflict. 
<br>
<br>
Until this point is reached, we cannot hear what we are told, which then leads to the next thing required for our growth: we must be able to understand what we hear, think for ourselves as individuals, and maintain an open mind in the midst of it all.
<br>
<br>
This may seem like an obvious statement because in some way it seems absurd to live a life where we don't understand what we hear, think for ourselves, and maintain an open mind. Yet if such knowledge were as basic in practice as it were is prescription, the world would be a very different place. It seems to be the case that these qualities are needed before they are gotten, that is, they cannot be honestly adopted until a certain level of pain or insight transpires.
<br>
<br>
The advent of this, however, is the befall of our 'brick and mortar' conditioning. Once we have stepped a bit outside of what we have taken for granted, there will come a point where we question all things. After all, how can we know such things are themselves not additional conditioning? 
<br>
<br>
At this point, we maintain confidence in the empirical but have lost the notion of certainty because it is that very thing which kept us stagnant in the first place. We seek knowledge and guidance for how to live and to act in a more proper way: a way which wakes and breathes us back into life, faintly resembling our previous condition.
<br>
<br>
But one needs time to pursue such knowledge and guidance, one needs sufficient resources to have such time and invest in the path itself. This is the other requisite and yet perhaps not much is needed if we forego superfluous things. 
<br>
<br>
We need the pain of our situation. We need the desire for more and an open mind to hear of it. We need time to study and practice, as well as the resources to continue on. We need a greater understanding of where we have come from, the characters we have cast for ourselves, and the people we can aspire to be. We need skills and a profound sense of curiosity. We need a faith in congruence: the alignment of our actions and our values.
<br>
<br>
Without these, we will reside where we are, believing ignorance to be bliss and yet all the while struggling harder than anyone to play the role we have cornered ourselves into.
<br>
<br>
Without these, we are fruitless.
