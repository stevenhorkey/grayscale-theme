Man must not merely intuit his present situation and all it entails, he must fully understand it on an experiential level if he is to go beyond where he is now.

He must see his current possibilities, difficulties, addictions, and presuppositions distinctly so that he may know they are not the way, but instead a way.

Thus there are two great drivers: the pain of one's current situation and the desire to know and become more. At the level that most of us reside, pain is going to be the kicker, the thing that shakes us from the foundation we were born an embedded into. We will have to come to a point where we can no longer tolerate it after many encounters of slamming our head against the wall. Here, we will try anything to get beyond our misery and rest on solid ground.

In a sense then, man cannot be told anything about growth until he is ready to listen, meaning until he truly wants to listen. Perhaps this is the reason why an intervention for some results in recognition and action, while for others it results in further conflict and entrenchment. 

Until this point is reached, he cannot hear what he is told, which then leads to the next thing required for his growth: man must be able to understand what he is told and think for himself.

Once he has stepped outside the conditioning he took for granted, there will come a point where he questions all things, because how can he be sure that they too are not additional forms of conditioning? 

He maintains confidence in the empirical but has lost the notion of certainty, because it is that very thing which kept him stuck in the first place. He seeks knowledge and guidance for how to live and to act in a more proper way: a way which brings him to live and ---- in comparison to his previous condition. 

But one needs time to pursue such knowledge and guidance, one needs sufficient resources to have such time and invest in the path itself. This is the other requisite yet perhaps not much is needed if one foregoes superfluous things. 

Man needs the pain of his situation. He needs the desire for more and open mind to hear of it. He needs time study and practice, as well as resources to continue on. He needs a greater understanding of where he has come from, who he has been, and who he wants to be. Man needs skill and a profound sense of curiosity; a faith in congruence.

Without these, man will reside where he is, believing ignorance to be bliss and yet all the while struggling harder than anyone to play the role he has cornered himself into.
