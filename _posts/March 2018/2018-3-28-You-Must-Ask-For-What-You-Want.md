How can we expect to get what we want if we do not ask for it? I know that not every man or woman has this problem, but I certainly have and I know that many of you have as well.

Perhaps it is a question of assertion, something which can seem too stern at times and at others downright inconsiderate.

Yet I think that this fear is misplaced in most cases, and it certainly is for those who have trouble with the subject at hand.

The fact that you care to not be rude or inconsiderate shows that your intention is correctly placed. As such, you are fit to make known what you want.

The thing we all must realize is that we are the only ones who will know what we truly want, and strive for it. In this sense, we are all marketers and salesmen, yet how often do you fail to tell others what you are 'up to' and what you are deeply passionate about? 

If you will not push for and assert yourself, who will? 

Perhaps you want a job position that would be much more fulfilling and worth your time. Surely you know that you are not the only one who would like it. Do you think that the other applicants will place your application before theirs with a golden sticker on it? No, as this is clearly not the case.

You are not being selfish or greedy by doing this, you are simply listening to what you want and not only is that good for you, it is also good for everyone involved with you.

Because how many of us know people who didn't do what they wanted in life and lived below their potential? How many of those people became so dissatisfied with themselves and their condition that they surrounded themselves with destructive habits and addictions only to dig their hole deeper?

For I know such a case is not rare and it seems to me that perhaps most of us will have to visit such a place before we 'see the light' to leave it.

And so whatever it is that you care about, whatever you create, and whatever opportunity sparks your muse, you must go for it. You must 'market it' in a very real sense because you cannot build a cathedral in your closet. 

There will always people who don't like you and your work. There will always be people who couldn't care less and yes, there will even people who do love your work and all it entails. 

You must be separate from these conditions, and look to please that inner calling from within. It knows best, but you must develop faith and let it have the opportunity to bud into the life that you desire and deserve.

For you only deserve it if you think and act in such a way where it deserves you.
