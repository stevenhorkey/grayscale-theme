description: "The subtleties and eccentricities of purpose may be difficult to spot, but if you knock on the door with a persistence greater than the lifetime you have thus far wasted, something will answer: something so senseless and grandiose yet right."

This whole term and notion of life purpose appears so vague and wistful. Perhaps more suiting would be direction, or meaning; something that is a genuine contribution to the world for its own sake. Something that ignites a deeper and more intimate love with life and with being itself.
<br>
<br>
__Yet we chase our tail only to sniff our ass and forget that such things are all too often under our nose the whole time, waiting and likely waning.__
<br>
<br>
What do you do purely for the love of it? That thing which you have perhaps done for years, had read books on, or loved when you were too young to believe it was a waste of time and thus 'money'?
<br>
<br>
Such things seem idyllic, and perhaps they are, but do you want to shoot for a life less than your ideal? For there is no greater way to make sure you don't get there. "In the long run," Thoreau said, **"men only hit what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better aim at something high."**
<br>
<br>
Anything less is the true waste, a loss that you get to bear if you scoff at the notion that meaning is anything less than the highest good.
<br>
<br>
Yet words, and especially these words, are slippery things, and **justification is far more prevalent in the eyes than on the page.**
And so if you wish to not merely take away the same ideology you brought to this encounter, read carefully: to place your life on the line for something you believe in is the bane yet breadth of life in the most surreal and archetypal sense. It had worked for Jesus, yet it has not for the Nazis, and one should wonder if there is a better, more humble way of living in the world.
<br>
<br>
You are not here to do anything; no one will hold your hand or a gun to your head to make sure you live a rewarding life made possible by the willingness to courageously carry its strife.
<br>
<br>
The subtleties and eccentricities of purpose are difficult to spot, but if you show up and knock on the door with a persistence greater than the life you have thus far wasted, if you can persist in the honest inward look towards what you simply and truly want, something will answer: something so non-sensical and grandiose, yet right.
<br>  
<br> 
Again and again, you must turn inward and ask those questions of what you want, why you want it, and what else is out there that is being overlooked.
<br>
<br>
There is no life purpose here, there is only _thy_ purpose here at this very moment in time. Just as you are the only one who can own your faults, you are the only one who can determine what you want to do with your time.
