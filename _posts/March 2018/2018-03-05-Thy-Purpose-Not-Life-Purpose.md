description: "The subtleties and eccentricities of purpose may be difficult to spot, but if you knock on the door with a persistence greater than the lifetime you have thus far wasted, something will answer: something so senseless and grandiose yet right."

There is no life purpose here, there is only _thy_ purpose now: at this moment in time. 
<br>
<br>
Yet that term purpose, appears so vague and wistful. Perhaps more suiting would be direction, or meaning, something that is a genuine contribution to the world for its own sake. Something that ignites a deeper and more intimate love with life; with being itself.
<br>
<br>
__Yet we chase our tail only to sniff our ass and forget that such things are all too often under our nose the whole time, waiting and perhaps waning.__
<br>
<br>
What do you do purely because you want to do it? That thing which you have perhaps done for years, have read books on, or loved when you were too young to care?
<br>
<br>
Such things seem idyllic, and perhaps they are, but do you want to shoot for a life less than your ideal? For there is no greater way to make sure you don't get there. "In the long run," Thoreau said, **"men only hit what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better aim at something high."**
<br>
<br>
Anything less is a waste, a waste you get to bear if you scoff at the notion that meaning is anything less than the highest good.
Yet words, and especially these words, are slippery things, and **justification is far more prevalent in the eyes than on the page.**
Read carefully then: to place your life on the line for something you believe in is the bane yet breath of life in the most archetypal sense. It has worked, yet it has not and one should wonder if there is a better, more humble way.
<br>
<br>
You are not here to do anything; no one will hold your hand or hold a gun to your head to make sure you live a just and righteous life.
<br>
<br>
The subtleties and eccentricities of purpose may be difficult to spot, but if you show up and knock on the door with a persistence greater than the lifetime you have thus far wasted, something will answer: something so non-sensical and grandiose, yet right.
<br>  
<br> 
Again and again, you must turn inward.
