*Why existence?*
<br>
<br>
People often dismiss philosophy, or more specifically, ontology, epistemology, and metaphysics as impractical jargon; seeing it as nothing more than verbose theory proudly made by hopeless theoreticians.
<br>
<br>
And these people would have a good point because there is plenty of that going on.
<br>
<br>
However, to claim that philosophy and the ponderance of the deepest and most existential questions are nothing more than a waste of time is, in my sincere opinion, naive. 
<br>
<br>
Because the study of ontology (the study of what exists and why) and epistemology (the study of knowledge and its validity - whether we can absolutely know anything) get to the heart of what "all this is," and what "all this is" includes you and your life. 
<br>
<br>
Whether consciously or unconsciously, we are all walking around inside of culture, and the very foundations of culture rest on epistemic assumptions; assumptions which make particular truth claims about the world.
<br>
<br>
Take, for example, the notion of free will: the entire criminal justice system rests on the idea that we as people have free will where we could've chosen otherwise. The answer to such a question, however, isn't entirely straightforward and there is plenty of rich conjecture to be had.
<br>
<br>
Another example is God. You may or may not be a believer in god, but aside from that mess of concept, we can't even agree what god is or what that word symbol is pointing to if it points to any *thing* at all.
<br>
<br>
What about a purpose to all this? What makes something true and why? What defines the boundary of what exists and how can we know if there is really an external 'physical' world independent of any single, or group of observers? 

The only way these questions could be considered settled is if you decided you didn't care enough to look at them right under your feet. Can you begin to see that your whole life, and what you fundamentally believe at the core of your entire person-hood is resting on quicksand?
<br>
<br>
Perhaps this is why we suffer. Perhaps this is why the mystics say we are all wrapped up in illusion. 
<br>
<br>
From my perspective, there is nothing in life quite like these questions, and besides getting to the point where everyone is treated with just respect and has what they need, what else is more important?
<br>
<br>
You could say that we will never be able to answer such questions, or even that it's up to science and not the philosophers.
<br>
<br>
For the sake of time,  I will not get into science aside from saying that it too is not free from interpretation or assumptions. Science, as it is practiced by many today, rests on a core set of axioms, which it has complete faith in. Not only this but if you ever get into the philosophy of science, you will quickly see how the mainstream view of it is extremely exaggerated in its explanatory power. This is because it can only speak of what things do and how they interact with each other, not what they are in and of themselves. 
<br>
<br>
Maybe then that concept is corrupt to begin with. Maybe there are only processes, and yet still maybe there are only babbling word games.
<br>
<br>
My point is that all fields, including science and philosophy, depend on philosophy, as we are all thinkers and dealers of thought.
<br>
<br>
And so if anything, I am an advocate of mystery, and I would go so far to say that there is still mostly, or only mystery. Science can be a great thing - a very insightful and useful thing. But one does not need to understand the underlying nature of the game to be able to play with and manipulate its contents.
<br>
<br>
And so maybe we will never be able to answer these questions, and in principle, I think this is probably the case, yet only in a limited sense. 
<br>
<br>
If it exists, perhaps the true theory of everything will be so powerful precisely because it fails to be a theory, and precisely because it's far too ineffable to be shared in symbols. Perhaps such a thing will instill the same conundrum we have with trying to explain sight to those who have never seen, for language can only refer to that which has been previously known and to that which is not the written or verbal symbol itself.
<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say, I hope not to answer any questions here - only to provoke more. Hopefully, that question though is at the forefront of your mind - why existence? Why does anything, including you and I, exist at all?
<br>
<br>
Maybe that word *'why'* doesn't encapsulate what I am trying to express though.
<br>
<br>
Maybe just *existence?*
<br>
<br>
What would you do if you found out that your entire worldview was a farce?
<br>
<br>
If you believe in god, what would you do if you found out that he/she didn't exist, or at least that your characterization of what god is has been completely mistaken?
<br>
<br>
What would you do if you found out that you don't exist, or at least that your characterization of who and what you are has been completely mistaken?
